# CapstoneProject
This is the repository for our Autism Symptom Tracking App. This application asks users a fixed set of questions each day. At the end of every week, a graph is displayed that displays the data tracked over the week. It suggests possible correlations, and suggestions for the user to improve symptoms. The app will also have a page for journal entries
