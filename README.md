# CapstoneProject
This is the repository for our Autism Symptom Tracking App. This application asks users a fixed set of questions each day. At the end of every week, a graph is displayed that displays the data tracked over the week. It suggests possible correlations, and suggestions for the user to improve symptoms. The app will also have a page for journal entries where the user can keep track of notes and behaviours from that day. There will be another page available from the main menu that allows the user to view graphs and suggestions from previous weeks.
